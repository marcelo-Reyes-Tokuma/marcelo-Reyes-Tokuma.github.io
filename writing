Human Skills Reflection

What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills Learning?

	- I learnt that I have a problem with self management and pushing my self to complete tasks when things get boring or uninteresting.
	- That when I practice mindfulness I become more consistent in my actions and words
	- That I want to be a kind person

What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?

	- Values, empathy and self awareness are applicable to both learning and programming. For learning, you allow yourself to learn and become better with your skill set. With programming as you learning how to interact with people and work with others.

What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?

	- How relevant it is int he work space.

Why do you think we, a programming school. Are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?

	- Because having an efficient and positive workspace with employees that can work with each other, products being shipped are better than a team that cannot work together and create a negative workspace

Does the time you spend studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used the time to practise programming instead Justify your answer.

	- I personally believe that teaching people how to be better people is a massive benefit to all, not only are you getting rid of that false dichotomy that people who work in tech are awkward and unable to work with others.

Neuroplasticity

	- Neuroplasticity is a topic of research, which shows that your brain is extremely resilient and is the process by which all permanent learning happens. It's also used to help people recover from detrimental brain damage such as strokes or injuries. Not limited to that it can also help people with learning disabilities, depression, addictions, and reverse obsessive compulsive patterns

	- To implement Neuroplasticity in your life you can begin it by how you learn. Repeatedly practicing an activity or recalling a memory while you study or whatever repeated action you take, you create electro chemical pathways that allow for strong memory recall. However the opposite can also happen if you begin to stop practising or learning new things, the brain can eliminate the pathway. 

	- Some way that you could increase your neuroplasticity is through learning new skills, engaging in physical exercise, healthy sleep, balanced diet and mindfulness.

Research Growth Mindset

	- A growth mindset promotes behaviours that help students achieve greater academic outcomes when combined with effective learning techniques. True learning can be uncomfortable and also brings confusion and disorientation, what sets apart growth mindset learners from the others is that they are willing to practise and persevere through confusion and challenge.

	- Something that surprised me was that it can help you relish challenge. I believe that out of all the helpful things that a growth mindset brings, this is the most useful.

	-     Recognize Fixed Mindset Traps. ...
    -Embrace Challenges. ...
    -Don't Fear Failure. ...
    -Value Effort. ...
    -Continue To Learn. ...
    -Cultivate Persistence. ...
    -Seek Out Constructive Feedback. ...
    -Surround Yourself With Growth-Minded People.

Blend with your learning plan and stratagies

	- I need this to help me learn. I struggle with fixed mindsets at points during my learning and  having a growth mindset could help me improve.

What is emotional Intelligence?

	- 'The ability to monitor one's own and other's feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guides one's thinking and actions' -Salvoey and Mayer 1990

How is EQ different to IQ?

	- While IQ is in relation to your logical reasoning, problem solving and Analytical skills, EQ refers to your aptitude for understanding and managing emotions, empathising with others and building effective interpersonal relationships. 

Why is EQ important?

	- The three primary benefits of strengthening EQ: Stellar Performance, Outstanding Leadership and Happiness.

What is your long term goal or career pathway?

 I want to create a successful business in the tech industry whether a consultancy or anything. 

A description of you strengths and weaknesses limitations when it comes to learning

	- Once I start succeeding, I have a strong urge to continue pushing
	- I love working things out, to the point I can be relentless 
	

	- If I fail once it can begin to affect my drive to move forward.
	- Once I get comfortable I can begin to slack off

What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? 

	I would like my work ethic to be improved and my thirst to improve skyrocket. I would like my mindset to be more growth oriented. To never be too comfortable.

A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other 		learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you

	While at the current moment I can slack off a bit if I get comfortable with my own learning, whenever I am in group work or I am working along side people I hate letting them down so I work my hardest so I am not a hinderance to others, in fact I prefer to be part of the leading force that drives the team. I also know that people work a different paces and learn different ways so I understanding that making space for that is important. When things get intense or emotions get high I first check myself that I'm thinking rationally and then begin to see if I can make sure the situation gets handled.

A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

I will reach out as soon as I am sure that I can't figure out the solution ( I give that problem at least a couple hours before I contact someone)

A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team

I hope for help across all my issues, as well as advice on anything I need.

Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

I'm terrible with time management unless I schedule things in, so I began scheduling in everything, my work, my gym time, when I clean, helping out the family.

Similarities

Boarders, padding's, and margins are ways to create spaces between the contents of the box
And the surrounding elements. The reason why they aren't all the same is because they allow 
For the manipulation of varying effects.

Differences 

How they differentiate are as follows: The space between content and the boarders itself is called padding. The boarder is the outside and can be styled, with colours and other effects. The margin is what keeps boxes from each other.
