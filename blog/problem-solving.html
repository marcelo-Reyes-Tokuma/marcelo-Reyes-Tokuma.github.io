        <p>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:

          Pseudocode
          Trying something
          Rubber ducky method
          Reading error messages
          Console.logging
          Googling
          Asking your peers for help
          Asking coaches for help
          Improving your process with reflection
      
      
        I believe that I am quite confident on all of these things.
      
      4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      
        I was reluctant on how to read through an array, I was thinking I should already know this, if I ask this will others think I'm dumb? I now know that I just need to ask, people ask me things about simple things and I never thing that they're dumb so why should someone else think that of me?</p>

        <p>1. were blocked on a simple problem:

          what was the problem?
      
        I couldn't pull my css properly that were sitting in other files
      
          what problem-solving techniques did you use?
        
        after banging my head on it for 10 minutes, I took a breather, googled, didn't understand any of the answers so I reached out to a friend of mine that does programming, answer was ../
      
          how did you feel throughout the process?
      
        frustrated, bigger problems I didn't fuss over because they were easy to get motivated out of but it was such a small thing that it really bothered me.
      
          what did you learn?
      
        take a breather first off, google after 5 minutes of struggle, I say 5 so I can get some time to check if I really am stuck.
      
      2. elegantly solved a problem.
      
          what was the problem?
      
        How to format different boxes evenly together
      
          what problem-solving techniques did you use?
      
        I time boxed my self 15 minutes to look through any options that I could find online, my chosen solution was flex box
      
          how did you feel throughout the process?
      
        Smart
      
          what did you learn?
      
        Limiting myself to an adequate amount of time allows me to urgently find more meaningful solutions </p>
