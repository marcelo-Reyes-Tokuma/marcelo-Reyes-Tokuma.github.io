        <p>Neuroplasticity

          - Neuroplasticity is a topic of research, which shows that your brain is extremely resilient and is the process by which all permanent learning happens. It's also used to help people recover from detrimental brain damage such as strokes or injuries. Not limited to that it can also help people with learning disabilities, depression, addictions, and reverse obsessive compulsive patterns</p>
          <br>
          <p>- To implement Neuroplasticity in your life you can begin it by how you learn. Repeatedly practicing an activity or recalling a memory while you study or whatever repeated action you take, you create electro chemical pathways that allow for strong memory recall. However the opposite can also happen if you begin to stop practising or learning new things, the brain can eliminate the pathway. </p>
          <br>
          <p>- Some way that you could increase your neuroplasticity is through learning new skills, engaging in physical exercise, healthy sleep, balanced diet and mindfulness.</p>

        <p>Research Growth Mindset

          - A growth mindset promotes behaviours that help students achieve greater academic outcomes when combined with effective learning techniques. True learning can be uncomfortable and also brings confusion and disorientation, what sets apart growth mindset learners from the others is that they are willing to practise and persevere through confusion and challenge.
