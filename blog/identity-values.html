          What is your long term goal or career pathway?

 I want to create a successful business in the tech industry whether a consultancy or anything. 

A description of you strengths and weaknesses limitations when it comes to learning

	- Once I start succeeding, I have a strong urge to continue pushing
	- I love working things out, to the point I can be relentless 
	

	- If I fail once it can begin to affect my drive to move forward.
	- Once I get comfortable I can begin to slack off

What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? 

	I would like my work ethic to be improved and my thirst to improve skyrocket. I would like my mindset to be more growth oriented. To never be too comfortable.

          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other 		learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you

      -While at the current moment I can slack off a bit if I get comfortable with my own learning, whenever I am in group work or I am working along side people I hate letting them down so I work my hardest so I am not a hinderance to others, in fact I prefer to be part of the leading force that drives the team. I also know that people work a different paces and learn different ways so I understanding that making space for that is important. When things get intense or emotions get high I first check myself that I'm thinking rationally and then begin to see if I can make sure the situation gets handled.

A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way

      -I will reach out as soon as I am sure that I can't figure out the solution ( I give that problem at least a couple hours before I contact someone)

A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team

      -I hope for help across all my issues, as well as advice on anything I need.

Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

      -I'm terrible with time management unless I schedule things in, so I began scheduling in everything, my work, my gym time, when I clean, helping out the family.
