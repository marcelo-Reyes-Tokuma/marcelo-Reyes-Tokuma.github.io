        <p>    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?

          Patience with myself and my problem solving are my biggest challenges 
          I have to maintain my humility while learning
          Journaling is my next step to success
        
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        
          They give you the tools need to work well and cohesively with your team and progress in your learning which in this field is always happening 
        
            What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
          
          That the values and virtues are something that I've heard my whole life and its interesting that they are being promoted here</p>

        <p>    What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?

          Writing about my thoughts
        
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        
          Employers look for an alright programmer and an amazing team player rather than an amazing programmer but shit team player
        
            Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        
          Nope, I think while I have been brought around a lot of these terms, seeing them from a different perspective that isn't close friends or family helped me see things in a new light, plus it was nice to hear how mindfulness is super important which just reaffirmed it for myself. For others, if you haven't been brought around these terms and not even sure what some of them mean, I think that it is very very helpful.
