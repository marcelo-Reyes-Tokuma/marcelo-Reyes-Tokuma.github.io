          <li><p> I learnt that I have a problem with self management and pushing my self to complete tasks when things get boring or uninteresting.</p></li>
          <li><p> That when I practice mindfulness I become more consistent in my actions and words</p></li>

            <p>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</p>
          </div>
          <p>Values, empathy and self awareness are applicable to both learning and programming. For learning, you allow yourself to learn and become better with your skill set. With programming as you learning how to interact with people and work with others.</p>

          <p>How relevant it is in the tech industry.</p>

            <p>Why do you think we, a programming school. Are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p>
          </div>
          <p>Because having an efficient and positive workspace with employees that can work with each other, products being shipped are better than a team that cannot work together and create a negative workspace</p>

          <div class="left-aligned">
            <p>Does the time you spend studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used the time to practise programming instead Justify your answer.</p>
          </div>
          <p>I personally believe that teaching people how to be better people is a massive benefit to all, not only are you getting rid of that false dichotomy that people who work in tech are awkward and unable to work with others.</p>
