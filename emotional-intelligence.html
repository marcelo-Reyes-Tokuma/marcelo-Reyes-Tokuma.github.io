          Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

Personally, I am 110% FOR mindfullness. Its something I've always thought of. I'm always checking if my actions and and words were the best version of myself. I'm always checking if my words even when  joking were kind and if my actions were polite. I belive that mindfullness is the ultimate tool for anyone to self improve and become their best versions.

How did you find the overall experience? 

I loved it; I feel happier, I'm able to lead others and take charge through practicing mindfullness.
